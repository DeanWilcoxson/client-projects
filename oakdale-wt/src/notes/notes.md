General Description: 
    Mock Project for a potential client.

Business Name: 
    Oakdale Window Tint

Address: 
    924B West F st Oakdale, CA (95361)

Initial Thoughts:
    Single-Page Application.
    React-scroll.
    Map will be hard to replicate.
    Make sure to Create different renders for automotive/ residential/ commercial customers.
        ie: Have a section the is for customers to Request A service (Similar to the Contact section they have already)
            also include a toggle button or something that switches between the three, and shows a form that will have different questions based on the type of service needed.
    Galleries will need to be replicated somehow as well.
